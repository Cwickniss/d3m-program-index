# Data-driven discovery of models (D3M) program index

A list of D3M-related tools and their repository URLs

## Pipeline infrastructure and tools
## TA1 Components

[BYU Primitives](https://github.com/byu-dml/d3m-primitives)

BYU-DML machine learning algorithms or primitives created for DARPA's D3M project. These primitives are wrapped to fit within the D3M ecosystem.

[JHU Primitives](https://github.com/neurodata/primitives-interfaces)

A collection of JHU Python interfaces for TA1 primitives in the D3M project.

[RPI Primitives](https://github.com/zijun-rpi/d3m-primitives)

RPI primitives for D3M project. Executable pipelines are included.

## TA3 Systems

## DataMart

DataMarts are data search engines. Given a problem and an dataset, those system can provide additional, relevant data and augment the initial dataset to enable the construction of a better model.
